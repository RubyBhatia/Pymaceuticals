# Pymaceuticals
The main objective of this analysis was to compare the performace of Pymaceuticals drugs named Capomulin with other treatment regimens. To evaluate 250 mice indentifies with SSC tumor growth. These were treated through a variety of drug regimens over a course of 45 days where the main observation and mesurmented was based on the development of tumor. For the purpose of analysis, four promising treatment regimens were take such as Capomulin, ramicane, Infubinol and Ceftamin.

Looking at the data, it can be seen that:

Capomulin had the hightest tumor volume of 230 with a Median of 41.56
Ramicane had 228 with a Median of 40.68
Infubinol had 178 with a Median of 51.82
Ceftamin had 178 with a Median of 51.78
These data explored that statistical significance since is obtained with a sample size =>30 as the number of data points for each drug is above 100.

As per the data related to the average final tumor volume, it seems like Capomulin and Ramicane both were very powerful in minimusing the risk of tumor volume in the mice over the 45 day study period compare to Infubinol and Ceftamin. Capomuline is more cosistent in its effects than Ramicane as per the outcome of the shortness of its box.

The line ploot 'Timepoint Versus Tumore Volume' demonstrates a downward trend of tumor shrinkage in the mice treated with the Capomulin treatment regimen. This suggests that prolonged and consistant treatment with Capomulin may give possitive result in reducing the tumor size, assuming other variables remain constant.

There was a strong correlation(R-sqared of 0.84) between the weight of the mice and thier average tumor volume. This shows that mouse weight must be controlled to obtain accurate results. If only the final tumor volume is considered without accounting for mouse weight, it could lead to a skewed interpretation of the drug's efficacy. acy.
